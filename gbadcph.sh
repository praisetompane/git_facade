#quick utility to add, commit files and push files

# commit message structure:
    # <type>[optional scope]: <description>
    # [optional body]
    # [optional footer(s)]

    # <type> values:
        # feat – a new feature is introduced with the changes
        # fix – a bug fix has occurred
        # chore – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for    example updating dependencies)
        # refactor – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
        # docs – updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files
        # style – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.
        # test – including new or correcting previous tests
        # perf – performance improvements
        # ci – continuous integration related
        # build – changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
        # revert – reverts a previous commit
